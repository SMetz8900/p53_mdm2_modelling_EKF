# P53 / Mdm2 Modeling using an EKF

- This repository contains the code for a project for the university course "Think Mathematically, Act Algorithmically: Optimization Techniques (Complementary Studies)" in the winter semester 24/25.

The project uses an Extended Kalman Filter to attempt to recover theoretical parameter values of a system of DDEs modeling p53 and Mdm2 interaction.
